## 🛡️ Vulnerability Management Projects

### [Modern Vulnerability Management Program](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Vulnerability-Management-Program)
This project provides an end-to-end simulation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, covering its entire lifecycle from initial design to final execution.
* **Tech Stack:** Tenable, Microsoft Azure, PowerShell, BASH
* **Key Outcome:** Reduced organizational risk by establishing a formal policy and executing a full-scope remediation cycle that eliminated 80% of identified vulnerabilities.

## 🕵️ Threat Hunting and Security Operations Projects

### [Threat Hunt: Unauthorized TOR Usage](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Threat-Hunt-Unauthorized-TOR-Usage)
Executed a comprehensive threat hunting scenario using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to detect and mitigate unauthorized anonymity tools within a controlled corporate environment.
* **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Kusto Query Language (KQL), Azure Virtual Machines
* **Key Outcome:** Developed advanced KQL queries to correlate file events, process execution, and network telemetry. Successfully identified the installation and usage of the TOR browser and triggered device isolation protocols to neutralize the risk.

## 🏗️ Identity & Systems Architecture

### [Azure-Based Windows Server Active Directory Lab](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Azure-AD-Lab-Environment/tree/main)
Architected a cloud-resident Windows Server 2022 environment in Microsoft Azure to simulate enterprise-scale identity management.
* **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Azure, AD DS, DNS, DHCP, GPO
* **Core Components:** Promoted a Domain Controller, designed a tiered OU structure, and implemented security-focused Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to manage users and group permissions in a realistic administrative scenario.

## 📱 Endpoint Engineering & Automation

### [Automated Android Provisioning (MDM & Automation)](https://christophermonteleone.github.io/pages/android-device-provisioning.html)
Designed and automated enterprise-wide Android endpoint provisioning to standardize security posture across 12+ sites and 200+ devices.
* **Tech Stack:** ManageEngine MDM, Zebra StageNow, Enterprise Home Screen
* **Impact:** Reduced device setup time by **50%** (from 60+ minutes to under 30 minutes) by engineering a repeatable factory-reset-to-in-service workflow using barcode kits and automated MDM group assignments.

## 🏠 Infrastructure & Virtualization

### [Self-Hosted Cloud & Virtualization Homelab](https://christophermonteleone.github.io/pages/self-hosted-cloud-virtualization-homelab.html)
Engineered a private infrastructure environment utilizing bare-metal virtualization and containerization for secure data management.
* **Tech Stack:** Proxmox VE, Ubuntu Server, Docker, NextCloud
* **Core Components:** Deployed Proxmox as a Type-1 Hypervisor to host various Linux server instances. Utilized Docker to containerize a NextCloud instance, creating a sovereign cloud solution for end-to-end file, photo, and video management.
