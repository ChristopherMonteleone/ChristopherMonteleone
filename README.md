## 🛡️ Vulnerability Management Projects

### [Modern Vulnerability Management Program](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Vulnerability-Management-Program)
This project provides an end-to-end simulation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, covering its entire lifecycle from initial design to final execution.
* **Tech Stack:** Tenable, Microsoft Azure, PowerShell, BASH
* **Key Outcome:** Reduced organizational risk by establishing a formal policy and executing a full-scope remediation cycle that eliminated 80% of identified vulnerabilities.

### [Automated STIG Compliance & Remediation](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/STIG-Compliance-And-Automation)
Developed a repository of PowerShell scripts to automate the remediation of high-severity Windows 10 vulnerabilities based on DISA STIG benchmarks. Followed a "Verify, Fix, Automate" workflow to translate manual registry edits into reproducible infrastructure-as-code.
* **Tools:** PowerShell, Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines), Windows 10, Group Policy (GPO), Registry Editor
* **Key Outcome:** Engineered 10 scripts to enforce security policies, successfully automating the transition from manual hardening to valid compliance.

## 🕵️ Threat Hunting and Security Operations Projects

### [Threat Hunt: Unauthorized TOR Usage](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Threat-Hunt-Unauthorized-TOR-Usage)
Executed a comprehensive threat hunting scenario using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to detect and mitigate unauthorized anonymity tools within a controlled corporate environment.
* **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Kusto Query Language (KQL), Azure Virtual Machines
* **Key Outcome:** Developed advanced KQL queries to correlate file events, process execution, and network telemetry. Successfully identified the installation and usage of the TOR browser and triggered device isolation protocols to neutralize the risk.

### [Threat Hunt: Hands on Keyboard Ransomware & Data Theft](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Threat-Hunt-Hands-on-Keyboard-Attack)
* **Tools Used:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Kusto Query Language (KQL), Windows Active Directory Environment
* **Key Outcome:** Developed advanced KQL queries to correlate process execution, network connections, and memory telemetry. Successfully traced a full hands-on-keyboard attack lifecycle, uncovering fileless credential dumping, lateral movement, staged exfiltration, and anti-forensic log clearing.

## 🏗️ Identity & Systems Architecture

### [Secure Hybrid-Cloud Network Merger & Zero Trust Implementation Project](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Secure-Hybrid-Cloud-Network-Merger)
Acted as the lead cybersecurity architect to design a secure, compliant network merger between a financial institution and a healthcare software provider. 
* **Tech Stack**: Hybrid-Cloud Architecture (IaaS), Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Network Micro-segmentation, IPsec VPNs, NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment Methodology.
* **Core Components**: Analyzed provided vulnerability reports and legacy network topologies to architect a modernized, micro-segmented hybrid environment. Aligned the proposed architecture with GLBA and PCI-DSS regulatory frameworks, and delivered a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis justifying the strategic shift from CapEx to OpEx cloud spending.

### [Azure-Based Windows Server Active Directory Lab](https://github.com/ChristopherMonteleone/Azure-AD-Lab-Environment/tree/main)
Architected a cloud-resident Windows Server 2022 environment in Microsoft Azure to simulate enterprise-scale identity management.
* **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Azure, AD DS, DNS, DHCP, GPO
* **Core Components:** Promoted a Domain Controller, designed a tiered OU structure, and implemented security-focused Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to manage users and group permissions in a realistic administrative scenario.

## 📱 Endpoint Engineering & Automation

### [Automated Android Provisioning (MDM & Automation)](https://christophermonteleone.github.io/pages/android-device-provisioning.html)
Designed and automated enterprise-wide Android endpoint provisioning to standardize security posture across 17+ sites and 350+ devices.
* **Tech Stack:** ManageEngine MDM, Zebra StageNow, Enterprise Home Screen
* **Impact:** Reduced device setup time by **50%** (from 60+ minutes to under 30 minutes) by engineering a repeatable factory-reset-to-in-service workflow using barcode kits and automated MDM group assignments.

## 🏠 Infrastructure & Virtualization

### [Self-Hosted Cloud & Virtualization Homelab](https://christophermonteleone.github.io/pages/self-hosted-cloud-virtualization-homelab.html)
Engineered a private infrastructure environment utilizing bare-metal virtualization and containerization for secure data management.
* **Tech Stack:** Proxmox VE, Ubuntu Server, Docker, NextCloud
* **Core Components:** Deployed Proxmox as a Type-1 Hypervisor to host various Linux server instances. Utilized Docker to containerize a NextCloud instance, creating a sovereign cloud solution for end-to-end file, photo, and video management.
