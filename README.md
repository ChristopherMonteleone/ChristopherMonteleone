# Chris Monteleone's IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio

I am focused on building and optimizing resilient security architectures. My work centers on the full lifecycle of security operations—from engineering cloud-based vulnerability management programs to automating threat detection workflows. This portfolio documents my hands-on approach to hardening environments and streamlining security processes through technical experimentation and deployment.
